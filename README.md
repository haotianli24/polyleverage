```bash
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Optional: Custom Solana RPC endpoint (recommended for production)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Architecture

### Backend API Routes

- `/api/polymarket/parse-url` - Parse Polymarket URLs
- `/api/polymarket/market` - Fetch individual market data
- `/api/polymarket/markets` - List active markets
- `/api/polymarket/positions` - Fetch user positions from CLOB
- `/api/bridge/quote` - Get bridge quote for SOL to Polygon
- `/api/bridge/sol-to-polygon` - Initiate bridge transaction

### Frontend Features

- **Markets Page**: Browse and analyze active Polymarket markets
- **Portfolio Page**: View your Polymarket positions
- **Settings Page**: Bridge SOL to Polygon for trading

## PLV Score Calculation

PLV (Price, Liquidity, Volume) score is calculated using:

- **Price Score** (30%): Based on distance from 0.5 (more directional = higher score)
- **Volume Score** (30%): Normalized to $1M cap
- **Liquidity Score** (40%): Normalized to $100k cap

Formula:
```
priceScore = min(|price - 0.5| * 2 * 100, 100)
volumeScore = min((volume / 1,000,000) * 100, 100)
liquidityScore = min((liquidity / 100,000) * 100, 100)
plvScore = round(priceScore * 0.3 + volumeScore * 0.3 + liquidityScore * 0.4)
```

## Bridge Flow

1. User enters SOL amount to deposit
2. System fetches real-time bridge quote from Wormhole
3. User signs Solana transaction in wallet
4. Transaction submitted to Wormhole guardian network
5. VAA attestation generated (10-15 minutes)
6. USDC redeemable on Polygon for Polymarket trading

See `BRIDGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for technical details.
